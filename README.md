# NUTRITION-ANALYSIS-USING-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION

The main objective of the project is to estimate the calories present in the food. Here,  input for the project is images. If the image is having any food item then that food item is  recognized and the corresponding calorie values for the item gets retrieved. Else if there is no  food item then a prompt like there is no food item present is displayed.  


As the project contains lot of files which exceeds the limit of 25MB and more than 100 files, I have uploaded the project in drive
